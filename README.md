This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing
TypeScript code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages.

## getting started

Heavily inspired by [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

### prerequisites

The project uses Deno as a TypeScript runtime, so you need to
[install](https://deno.land/#installation) it first.

Then, [install](https://github.com/jurassiscripts/velociraptor#install)
