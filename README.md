This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing
TypeScript code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages.

## getting started

Heavily inspired by [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

### prerequisites

The project uses Deno as a TypeScript runtime, so you need to
[install](https://deno.land/#installation) it first.

### ready to run ðŸš€

```
deno task start
```

## development

Before submitting a PR:
